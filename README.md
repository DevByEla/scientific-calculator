# Scientific Calculator

This project is a **JavaScript-based scientific calculator** that provides both basic and advanced operations, along with a history feature for keeping track of previous calculations.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Supports standard arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Functions**: Includes trigonometric (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic (ln, log), exponentiation, and factorial functions.
- **History Feature**: Tracks all previous calculations with a timestamp, allowing users to review their calculation history.
- **Clear Function**: Short press clears the last input (CE), while a long press resets the calculator (AC).
- **Toggle Modes**: Users can switch between basic operations (`123`) and advanced functions (`fx`) with dedicated buttons.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the calculator.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface, buttons, and the calculator's overall look.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the logic behind the calculator operations and managing user interactions.

## How to Use

1. Enter numbers and operators using the calculator's buttons.
2. Switch between basic (`123`) and advanced (`fx`) modes using the toggle buttons.
3. View your calculation history by clicking the "History" button.
4. Press "=" to evaluate the entered expression.
5. Long-press the "AC/CE" button to reset the calculator or short-press to clear the last entry.

## Note

- For some operations, such as sine, cosine, or logarithms, the number needs to be placed between parentheses. For example, to calculate the sine of 5, input sin(5).

## Future Improvements

- Add more advanced functions (inverse trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions).
- Improve the user interface with better design and animations.
- Extend the history feature to allow saving or exporting calculations.
